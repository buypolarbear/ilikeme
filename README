Linux userspace driver for TVW750 devices (currently only the TVW750USB/TVW750U).

In order to generate easily readable packet traces, use the provided XSL:
* capture a trace under Wireshark
* disable (sub)protocol dissection (esp. PPP)
* File -> Export -> as XML - "PDML" (packet details) file...
* $ xsltproc -o cap.txt docs/ati_wireshark.xsl cap.xml
* $ sed -i -e '/^[RW] | $/ d' cap.txt
* $ perl docs/ati-readable.pl cap.txt > cap-readable.txt
* $ perl docs/ati-array.pl cap.txt > cap-array.txt

The firmware files will not be hosted in this repo until I receive permission
from ATI/Broadcom/whoever owns the rights to them.  To generate the first one,
or at least a version of the first one, do the following:
* download the Windows driver
* find CTRL.s3, CTRLT506.s3, CTRLT507.s3, CTRLT511.s3
* for s3 in *.s3 ; do ( base=`basename $s3 .s3` ; objcopy -I srec -O binary $s3 $base.bin ) ; done

There is a second blob uploaded later in the process which I haven't found the
source to as of yet.  You can, however, extract it from a packet trace.
